## Clock

The clock is a square wave at 50% duty cycle and is used for triggering and synchronizing operations in the computer. Supports variable speed from 1.5Hz to 1kHz and also single stepping.

* Chips
  * 3x 555
    * The first is in astable mode. It generates a 50% duty cycle square wave for a continuous clock timer.
    * The second is in monostable mode. It's used as a debounce circuit for the single step push button, to generate a manual pulse.
    * The third is in bistable mode. It's used as a debounce circuit for mode toggle switch.
  * 74LS04 inverter: these 3 last chips are for creating the logic circuit that allows outputting the clock signal from the selected mode, as well as disabling the clock output when halted.
  * 74LS08 AND gate
  * 74LS32 OR gate
* Inputs
  * Potentiometer: for controlling the speed of the clock.
  * Push button: for single stepping the clock.
  * Toggle switch: for switching between continuous mode or single step mode.
* Outputs
  * The normal clock signal.
  * The inverted clock signal.
* LEDs
  * 3x Yellow
    * The first shows the square wave from the first 555 timer.
    * The second shows the debounced output of the second 555 timer.
    * The third shows the mode the clock is in. The LED is off in single step mode and on in continuous mode.
  * Blue: this LED shows the normal outgoing clock signal, either in sync with the clock timer or the single steps. 
* Control signals
  * HLT: halts the clock.


## Memory Address Register (MAR)

A 4-bit (0->15) register that keeps track of the active memory address for the RAM. 

Can be put in programming mode together with the RAM for manual control with DIP-switches.

* Chips
  * 74LS173 register: for storing the current 4-bit address in run mode.
  * 74LS157 multiplexer: for selecting between the address from the MAR or from the DIP-switch.
* Inputs
  * 4-bit DIP switch: for setting the address in programming mode.
  * Toggle switch: for switching between run mode and programming mode. Also applies to the RAM.
* Outputs
  * The 4-bit address from the selected run mode goes to the RAM.
* LEDs
  * Green/Red mode: for showing the mode. Green for run mode and red for programming mode.
  * 4x Yellow address LEDs: shows the current 4-bit address in the selected mode.
* Control signals
  * MI: store a 4-bit address from the bus in the MAR.


## Random Access Memory (RAM)

16 bytes of static RAM.

Any of the 16 bytes can be read and written to, but it behaves like a regular 8-bit register in that it only works with 1 byte at a time. The MAR must be used for selecting which byte to read from or write to.

Can be put in programming mode together with the MAR for manual control with DIP-switches.

* Chips
  * 2x 74189 RAM: for storing for 16 bytes of data or instructions. The outputs are inverted.
  * 2x 74LS04 inverter: to invert back the data in the RAM.
  * 74LS245 buffer: to control when it's outputting to the bus.
  * 3x 74LS159 multiplexer
    * The first is used for controlling whether the program button or the RI control signal can write to the RAM depending on mode.
    * The two others are used for selecting between the 8-bits of data coming from the bus or from the DIP-switch depending on mode.
  * 74LS00 NAND gate: enables the RI control signal only on the rising edge of the clock. 
* Inputs
  * 4-bit memory address from the MAR.
  * Push button: for setting the value from the DIP switch into the current memory address of the RAM in programming mode.
  * 8-bit DIP switch: for setting the value at the current address in programming mode.
  * Toggle switch: for switching between run mode and programming mode. From the MAR. Goes into all the multiplexers.
* LEDs
  * 8 Red LEDs: for showing the 8-bit value at the current address in RAM.
* Control signals
  * RI: store an 8-bit value from the bus in the current memory address.
  * RO: put an 8-bit value from the current memory address to the bus.


## Reset

Reset button that connects to all the different parts of the computer to clear the state. This is required before starting a program since the computer comes up in a random state, and when restarting a program.

* Chips
  * 74LS00 NAND gate: for creating the necessary signals that will reset the other chips.
* Inputs
  * Push button: for initiating a reset.


## Instruction Register

8-bit register that contains the currently executing instruction.

Instructions are made up of an opcode and an operand, both 4 bits each. The opcode tells which instruction to execute while the operand contains extra data related to the instruction, like a memory address to jump to, or a small value to put into another register. See [instruction_set.md](instruction_set.md) for more about instructions.

The instruction register is very similar to the general purpose A and B registers, except how it's used. The 4 bits for the opcode goes to the instruction decoder, and only the 4 bits of the operand can be put out onto the bus.

* Chips
  * 2x 74LS173 register: these are used for storing the 8-bit instruction.
  * 74LS245 buffer: to control when it's outputting to the bus.
* Outputs
  * The opcode: goes directly to the instruction decoder.
* LEDs
  * 4 Blue: shows the opcode.
  * 4 Yellow: shows the operand.
* Control lines
  * II: store an 8-bit value from the bus in the register.
  * IO: put the 4-bit operand of the instruction to the bus.
